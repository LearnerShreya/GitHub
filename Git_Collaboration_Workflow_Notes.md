# 👥 Collaborating with Others, Branch Safety & GitHub Workflows – Simplified Notes

---

## 1️⃣ Collaborating with Others (Forks, Pull Requests, Code Reviews)

### 🍴 Forking a Repo

* Fork = Make **your own copy** of someone else’s GitHub repo.
* Use when you want to **contribute but don’t have edit access**.

### 📥 Cloning Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
```

* Clones your forked repo to your local machine.

### 🌿 Creating a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

* Always create a new branch to make changes.

### ✅ Add, Commit & Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 🔃 Opening a Pull Request (PR)

* Go to your fork on GitHub
* Click **“Compare & Pull Request”**
* Add a title and description → Submit PR

🧠 PR = You’re asking the original owner to merge your changes.

## 2️⃣ Working with Branches Safely

### 🔐 Stashing Changes

```bash
git stash
```

* Temporarily saves your uncommitted work

```bash
git stash apply
```

* Bring the stashed changes back

---

### 🔁 Rebasing (Advanced)

```bash
git rebase main
```

* Rewrites your branch to start from the latest `main`
* Keeps history **clean and linear**
* Use before pushing

---

### 🍒 Cherry-Picking a Commit

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

* Apply a **single commit** from another branch to your current branch

## 3️⃣ GitHub Workflows (GUI vs CLI, Issues, Actions)

### 🖥️ Git CLI vs GitHub GUI

| Action      | CLI                      | GitHub Website (GUI)     |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Clone repo  | `git clone <url>`        | "Code" → Copy link       |
| Make branch | `git checkout -b <name>` | "Branch → New" on web    |
| Make PR     | Push first, then web PR  | "Compare & pull request" |
| Issues      | ❌                        | Use "Issues" tab         |

---

### 📝 Issues

* Report bugs, request features, or assign tasks
* Helps teams organize work

---

### 🧪 GitHub Actions

* Automate testing, deployment, etc.
* Use `.yml` files inside `.github/workflows/`

🧠 Example: Auto-run tests when someone pushes code
